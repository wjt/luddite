Some of my IRC contacts write like this[:](http://everything2.com/user/Akilae/writeups/Haiku):

    < Akilae> I told her and she
    < Akilae> Was like, ``oh, my god,'' and I
    < Akilae> Was like, ``oh, my god.''

These <acronym>LATEX</acronym>-esque Luddite quotes bother me, so I wrote a
script for Irssi to replace them with real balanced quotes:

    < Akilae> I told her and she
    < Akilae> Was like, “oh, my god,” and I
    < Akilae> Was like, “oh, my god.”

I'm aware of the irony of being an Irssi user who calls other people Luddites.
